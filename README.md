Throwaway repo for measuring OpenSim's perf for basic simulations (from the tutorials [here](https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu/display/OpenSim/Examples+and+Tutorials)).

This repo just contains some scripts/opensim configs etc. that I'm
using to setup + measure opensim performance metrics. It exists only
so that I can link to scripts etc. online.
